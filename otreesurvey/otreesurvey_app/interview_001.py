    "In this interview, we're talking about meat-eating habits. Is this something you've thought much about, or not really?",
    "It's interesting to hear that you've given this topic a lot of thought. I'd love to get a sense of your own habits—can you tell me a bit about how often you eat meat these days, and what kinds of meats you tend to choose?",
    "Thanks for sharing that—it's interesting that you mostly eat meat in more convenient settings, like sandwiches or eating out, but don't cook it at home. What are some of the reasons behind these choices? For example, are there practical reasons, like ease or cost, or more ethical or health considerations that come into play for you?",
    "Thank you for explaining that—it's clear that animal welfare and ethical concerns play a big role in your decisions around eating meat. I'm curious, do you find that your friends, family, or people you spend time with have similar eating habits or motivations when it comes to meat, or do they approach things differently?",
    "It sounds like your living situation and close relationships have a strong influence on your own meat-eating habits, especially since you live with vegetarians and don't cook meat at home. I'm interested to know—have you noticed any differences in the specific reasons your friends or family give for being vegetarian or vegan? For example, do they focus on ethical concerns like you, or do other motivations, like health or environmental reasons, come up as well?",
    "Thank you for clarifying that—it's interesting to hear that while you and your friends share ethical motivations, there are some subtle differences in what feels most important to each of you. Thinking about the broader picture, do you ever feel any social pressure, encouragement, or even challenges from your social circle around your meat-eating choices, or is it generally a supportive environment for you?",

    "Yes, this is something I have thought a lot about.",
    "Yeah, I mean, I eat meat probably a few times a week and that is often meat slices for sandwiches or when I'm eating out, it could be pizza with meat on or whatever. So I don't cook meat at home.",
    "I think either cost are not so important for me. I think it's relatively easy for me to access both meat and not meat. Health is also not a big consideration. It is important for me to get enough protein, but I think I can cover that okay without meat. I think ethical reasons are more important to me. I'm very concerned about animal welfare in particular. I think that most meat is produced unethically, so this is a big concern for me.",
    "I think most of the people I am surrounded by are not too dissimilar. I live with vegetarians, so there's never any meat that is cooked in my apartment, which is also a big reason that I don't do it, I think. And a lot of the most important people for me are vegetarian and vegan. So yeah, in that sense, that's pretty aligned, I would say.",
    "I think most of my friends are pretty aligned, I mean, I do think that the biggest concern for them also in general is animal welfare, although some of them might be more concerned more generally about the impact on climate change and ecology more broadly, whereas for me it really is about animal suffering primarily, I think that's the most salient. I don't think health is important actually, mostly for them.",
    "I'm not sure I would say I feel social pressure. It's definitely more and more natural for me to not consume meat than it used to be just because more people around me are not eating meat. So maybe there is like an indirect pressure, but it's not something that is often brought up directly, I would say."
